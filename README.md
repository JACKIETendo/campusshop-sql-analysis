Analysis Phases

Phase 1 – Database Exploration
- View all tables and their structure (`SHOW TABLES`, `DESCRIBE`)
- Preview sample data from each table
- Count total records per table
SQL Skills Practiced: `SHOW TABLES`, `DESCRIBE`, `SELECT *`, `LIMIT`, `UNION ALL`, `COUNT()`

Phase 2 – Data Cleaning
- Find missing values (NULL checks)
- Detect duplicate records
- Identify pricing errors (zero price)
- Flag out-of-stock active products
SQL Skills Practiced: `IS NULL`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT()`, conditional `WHERE`

Phase 3 – Core Analysis
- Total revenue and average order value
- Revenue by order status and payment method
- Monthly sales trends
- Product popularity by category
- Best-selling products
- Customer order frequency
- Delivery location breakdown
SQL Skills Practiced: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `DATE_FORMAT()`, `LEFT JOIN`

Phase 4 – Advanced Queries
- Multi-table JOINs (4 tables in one query)
- Subqueries (queries inside queries)
- CTEs – Common Table Expressions (`WITH` clause)
- Window Functions: `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `SUM() OVER()`
- Running totals and category rankings
SQL Skills Practiced:`JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `WITH`, `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `PARTITION BY`, `OVER()`

Phase 5 – Business Insights
- Executive dashboard summary
- Category revenue performance
- Urgent stock restock report
- Customer loyalty tiers (VIP, Loyal, Regular)
- Product movement & loss analysis
- Innovation Hub performance
- Order fulfillment rate
- Customer feedback response analysis
SQL Skills Practiced:`CASE WHEN`, `COALESCE()`, `TIMESTAMPDIFF()`, `DATEDIFF()`, advanced aggregations
Key Business Findings
1. Bags and T-Shirts are the highest revenue categories.
2. Several products like **Tote bags and Laptop bags** have very low stock and high cart demand.
3. User 1 (Tendo) is the most active customer with the most orders and highest spend.
4. Mobile Money is the dominant payment method used by customers.
5. The fulfillment rate (orders that reached Delivered status) needs monitoring.
6. Customer feedback response time ranged widely some replies took many hours.
7. The Innovation Hub has 4 student projects, 3 approved, 1 pending.

Tools Used
